        <h3 id="subtitle">As a developer, you might have heard of FireBase. But do you know about.....WaterBase ??</h3>

            <p>I've always admired Android in the way of storing persistent data. If you are famaliar with Android Development, you'd know about Shared Preferences. If that's new to you, it is basically a storage utility that Android provides using which you can store data in Key-value form. Shared Preferences are suitable in different situations. For example, when the userâ€™s settings need to be saved or to store data that can be used in different activities within the app.</p>
            <p>But...we don't get that awesome feature outside the Android environment. Do we? So I decided to create a lightweight storage utility that provides such behavior and can be used on any platform. And voila...WaterBase was born ;)</p>

            <h4>So first thing's first. Why the name ?</h4>
            <p>Ok...so here's my explanation. As we all know that ðŸ”¥FireBase is a  database that is in cloud and can be accessed from anywhere. And so WaterBase is a database on your hard disk that can be accessed from anywhere...just like <i>water</i>ðŸŒŠ...simple and lightweightðŸª¶.</p>
            <h4>How it's used ?</h4>
            <p>As promised, in the easisest way...<br>WaterBase is currently available in C++ and Python</p>
            <quote>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.</quote>
            <p>Ok then...here's the Python version</p>
